# Azure Function to consume RabbitMQ messages
Azure Functions integrates with RabbitMQ via triggers and bindings. The Azure Functions RabbitMQ extension allows you to send and receive messages using the RabbitMQ API with Functions

Because it doesn't exist a Logic App connector, this Azure Function will act as the Logic App connector and will do the bridge between RabbitMq and the Logic App.

# Azure Functions: Convert XML into JSON
This Azure Function converts a XML payload to JSON. This function can be used to modernize APIs based on XML-only backend web services.

Our main objective in creating this function was to be used in Azure API Management in order to overcome some non-conforming behaviors of the xml-to-json policy.
